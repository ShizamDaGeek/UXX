Introduction

UXX is a library made for C++ to create good looking UI for your C++ applications.
Most modern UI libraries are either too complex, too old, performance tanking or 
made for other purposes (like ImGui for game engines).

UXX aims to provide a simple and intuitive API for creating UI for your C++ app and games.
It is designed to be easy to use and understand, while still providing powerful features.

I personally decided to make this project mainly because I found a roadblock when it came
to making good UI for my OpenGL game. I also wanted to learn more about C++ and graphics 
programming, and I think that this is a good project to work on.
